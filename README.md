# caveWalls
## React + Vite + SUPABASE + SHADCN + TAILWIND
### The IDEA
- A website where everyone can share their favorite wallpapers

- connect their wallet so they can get credit or be tipped

- add adSense to the website, then reward the most saved wallpapers uploader

- pinterest style grids, minimalist, no long stress, just visit site, connect wallet if you want to, download free walls

## ROADMAP

- `GOAL`: Fully working wallpaper website before adding the crypto part

- `PAGES`:
`/` - home page, infinite grid with endless wallpapers, `/wall/:id` - search for a specific wallpaper by id, `/upload` - upload page for creators, `/profile/:username` - creator profile
- `REQ`: Masonry grid layouts, Lazy loading images, Download button mechanism, an `algorithm` to decide what conetent to display first
